# Text Summarization for Urdu and English mixed language

This project implements a text summarization algorithm for mixed languages, specifically Urdu and English. The algorithm includes POS tagging and TF-IDF calculation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Pandas

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```git
https://github.com/saadfareed/mixedlanguage-summarization.git
```
2. Install libraries 
```python
pip install scikit-learn nltk pandas
```


## Results
The program outputs the summarized text, along with the POS tags and TF-IDF values for each word.

## Limitations
The algorithm is limited by the quality and size of the training dataset. It may not perform well on text in languages other than Urdu and English or with vastly different structures and vocabulary.

## Future work
- Improving the summarization algorithm to handle a wider range of languages and text structures.
- Integrating a sentiment analysis component to the algorithm.
- Increasing the size of the training dataset to improve the accuracy of the results.
